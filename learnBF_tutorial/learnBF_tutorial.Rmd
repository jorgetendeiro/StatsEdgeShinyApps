Let's test your knowledge of the Bayes factor!

We will focus on the same independent samples $t$-test setting from this tutorial:
$$\mathcal{H}_0: \mu_1=\mu_2 \quad \text{ versus } \quad \mathcal{H}_0: \mu_1\not=\mu_2.$$

Equivalently, defining parameter $\mu_D$ as $(\mu_1-\mu_2)$, we can re-express $\mathcal{H}_0$ and $\mathcal{H}_1$ as follows:
$$\mathcal{H}_0: \mu_D=0 \quad \text{ versus } \quad \mathcal{H}_0: \mu_D\not=0.$$
